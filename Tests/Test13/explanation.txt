in this test we are checking for double counts for a hacker
there is one hacker and he wants two courses
he is already in the first course he wants and after enqueueing
will be there twice, but should be only counted once into the 
"total courses gotten count"
he will not be able to get into the second course because
he has a lot of enemies in the line
so in total he got 1 out of 2 courses he wanted,
which should return "cannot satify constraints"
